    "1. Edit/Create an git \"exclude\" file in the main portfolio directory \".git/info\".  Add \"yolov3.weights\" on a line by itself.  This avoids a git push failure due to the size of the file.\n",
    "1. Fill in the missing code in this notebook  (You will need the working code examples to do the next step)\n",
    "1. Create a python class that allows the following\n",
    "   - Reads in the image\n",
    "   - Create a loop that alters individual changes of the items below to determine names of identified objects and their confidence (down to when the object detetion is lost).  Remember to reset the image through each pass as they are not iterative.\n",
    "     - size\n",
    "     - rotation\n",
    "     - noise (of your choice)\n",
    "   - Graph the results\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Steps for Part 2 - Object Detection\n",
    "1.  Generate a web interface python script that ingests a POST command of a picture Use [postman](https://www.postman.com/) to generate the post with picture of your choice.\n",
    "1.  Returns the items detected and the assocated confidence\n",
    "1.  Add to your python class above to offer this capability\n",
    "1.  Test web interface locally\n",
    "1.  Create a Dockerfile and build the image\n",
    "1.  Test the Dockerfile locally\n",
    "1.  Push notebook, python script, readme, etc to your github portfolio (since you are in the right location locally you just need to do a push at the main directory of the portfolio (after git add * and git commit -m \" comment)\n",
    "1.  Push locally built and test docker image to your docker hub portfolio.  Manually add to docker readme.\n",
