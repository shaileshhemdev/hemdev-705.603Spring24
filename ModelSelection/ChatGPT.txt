Title: Model Selection Assignment in Machine Learning

Objective: The goal of this assignment is to develop a systematic approach for selecting the most suitable machine learning model for a given problem. Students will explore various aspects of the dataset and problem characteristics to make informed decisions about choosing the right model.

**Assignment Components:**

1. **Introduction to the Problem (10 points):**
   - Describe the problem statement and the dataset you will be working with.
   - Highlight the importance of selecting the right machine learning model for optimal performance.

2. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing (20 points):**
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the dataset.
   - Identify and handle missing values, outliers, and any other data preprocessing steps.
   - Provide visualizations to illustrate key insights about the data.

3. **Model Selection Criteria (15 points):**
   - Explain the criteria for selecting a machine learning model, considering factors such as:
      - Size of the dataset
      - Nature of the problem (classification, regression, clustering)
      - Interpretability requirements
      - Computational resources available
      - Presence of categorical or numerical features

4. **Model Options (25 points):**
   - Introduce at least three different types of machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, etc.).
   - Explain the strengths and weaknesses of each model type.
   - Provide code snippets (or references) for implementing each model using a popular machine learning library (e.g., scikit-learn).

5. **Model Evaluation and Comparison (20 points):**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train each of the selected models on the training set.
   - Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).
   - Provide visualizations (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curves) to compare the models' performances.

6. **Conclusion and Model Selection (10 points):**
   - Summarize the findings from the evaluation and comparison.
   - Select the most suitable model based on the criteria and justify the choice.
   - Discuss any limitations or assumptions made during the model selection process.

7. **Code Implementation (optional, extra credit):**
   - Encourage students to implement the entire process using a programming language of their choice.
   - Include code snippets for key steps, such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

**Submission Requirements:**
- Submit a well-documented report (PDF or Word) including explanations, visualizations, and code snippets.
- Include any additional resources or references consulted during the assignment.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Clarity and completeness of the problem statement and dataset exploration.
- Appropriateness of model selection criteria and justification.
- Accuracy and relevance of model evaluations and comparisons.
- Quality of documentation, including code readability and organization.

This assignment aims to guide students through a structured process of selecting the most appropriate machine learning model for a given problem, promoting a deeper understanding of the factors influencing model choice.
