# Artificial Intelligence Portfolio

This repository has a lot of samples to showcase my work for Artificial Intelligence. 

## Sample Machine Learning Microservice

This sample shows how to build a simple REST API interface over a Machine Learning Model implementation. The REST API is built using Flask and exposed through a Docker container that can be pulled 

See documentation [here](ML_Microservice_Example-master/README.md)

If you want to go straight to the Docker image to pull and run you can go here [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/tomsriddle/ml-microservice)
